 <h3>what are the requirements to Organize a free Medical camp?</h3>
 <div id="m1"><img src="OIP.jfif" width="500px " ></div>
 <pre><p1>       Free medical camps are organized to provide health services and create an 
    environment where the underprivileged community gets sensitive about health issues. 
    Thousands of poor people in villages and urban areas attend the health camps.
    
        These camps provide free tests for Diabetes, Blood Pressure, Hemoglobin etc and 
    offers counseling & treatment by trained Doctors and Specialists. Free medicines are 
    given to the people. Iron and Folic Acid supplements are also distributed to the 
    malnourished at the camp. The underprivileged community also has aging members who 
    are not able to purchase health care and access the facilities due to the long distance 
    and other joint problems that have demobilized them. 
    
        Apart from providing basic treatment and general check-up, the Medical Camps also help 
    people to be aware of their health status. Often these camps provide support exclusively for 
    adolescent girls and boys to inform them on reproductive and sexual health. Sanitary pads are 
    distributed to adolescent girls to encourage better hygiene practices during menstruation. 
   </p1>
  <p2>
    <h4> Importance and Objectives of the Free Medical Camp</h4>
   <h5> Requirements for a medical camp:</h5>
          The main objective of all medical camps is to bring affordable healthcare and free health information to the community and 
    identify the common health problems in order to devise ways of addressing them. A lot of logistic supports are needed to carry out 
    such responsible programs successfully.
           Therefore a list of the requirements is  presented below. Additional financial resources will be required for transportation 
    of supplies, personnel, and volunteers from one region to another. Heavy security is required  and sufficient nonmedical personnel 
    to assist with registration and the management of the crowds.

      <ol> Local applications,</ol> 
    <br>
    Though some commonly used drugs have been suggested here, it is always better to consult a physician about which drugs are required for specific medical camps. A thorough research can be conducted within the community to find out the prevalent diseases in particular areas and drugs can be administered  accordingly.
